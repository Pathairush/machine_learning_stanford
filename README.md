# Coursera - Machine Learning (Stanford)

:wave: 

Hi everyone, Hers is the repository that I implemented the assigment of [Machine learning course provided by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) in python language.
The original course is taught all the assigments in `Octave/Matlab` programming languages. I highly recommended anyone who have never taken this course before and would like to improve your understanding about the machine learning to take the course.

I once finished the course in 2017. It was really long time ago.
And now, I think it is a good time to re-learn the foundation knowledge of machine learning knowledge again in 2021.

I did implement the code accroding to the `PDF` and `data` provided in each subfolder.

# Learning objective
- Refresh your machine learning knowledge.
- Implement suppemental functions that the course was already provided by yourself.
